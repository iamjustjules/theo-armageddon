To complete the form using the details derived from the Terraform setup discussed for the European gaming company, we'll assume hypothetical values for some fields like student name, pre-shared keys, and specific IP ranges for internal and external VMs that are not explicitly mentioned in the original discussion. Here's how you might fill out the form:

European Office (Headquarters)
My 1st VPC: European VPC  
My Peering Region: europe-west1 (assuming)  
My student name: Juan Francais
My VPC Subnet IP Range: 10.0.0.0/24  
My internal VM IP Range: 10.0.0.4/32 (example)  
My external VM IP Range: Not applicable (no internet access)  
My project name: European Gaming HQ  
My project ID#: example-project-id-1  

American Office (First VPC)
My 2nd VPC: US VPC1  
My Peering Region: us-west1  
My student name: John Smith
My VPC Subnet IP Range: 172.16.0.0/24  
My internal VM IP Range: 172.16.0.4/32 (example)  
My external VM IP Range: [Public IP here from GCP after VM deployment]  
My project name: European Gaming American Office  
My project ID#: example-project-id-1  

pre-shared key: secret-key-123  

American Office (Second VPC)
My 2nd VPC: US VPC2  
My Peering Region: us-east1  
My student name: Jane Smith
My VPC Subnet IP Range: 172.16.1.0/24  
My internal VM IP Range: 172.16.1.4/32 (example)  
My external VM IP Range: [Public IP here from GCP after VM deployment]  
My project name: European Gaming American Office  
My project ID#: example-project-id-1  

pre-shared key: secret-key-456  

Asian Office
Partner Peering Region: asia-east1  
Partner student name: Ricky Tan
Partner VPC Subnet IP Range: 192.168.0.0/24  
Partner internal VM IP Range: 192.168.0.4/32 (example)  
Partner external VM IP Range: [Public IP here from GCP after VM deployment, if applicable]  
Partner project name: European Gaming Asia Pacific Office  
Partner project ID#: example-project-id-2  

This configuration outlines a network setup where Europe serves as the headquarters, and the American and Asia Pacific offices connect to the European network with specific network configurations and security measures. Note that for a real-world application, some of these values (like student names and project IDs) will vary based on the actual Google Cloud Platform setup and organizational structure.
