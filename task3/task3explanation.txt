Here's how each component works:
Providers
- Provider Block configures the credentials and region for Terraform to interact with GCP to authenticate and make API calls.
Resources
- Network Resources define the VPC and subnetworks in specified regions. They create network environments, define IP address ranges, and managing how resources communicate.
- Compute Instance provisions VMs. They define machine type, associated network and subnetwork, boot disk image, and startup scripts.
- VPN Gateway and Peering Resources manage the connectivity between networks within the same region or across regions. VPN gateways secure connections and network peering allows networks to communicate.
- Firewall Rules control traffic into and out of your VMs. Theyâ€™re configured to restrict traffic to specific ports and IP range for security.
- Startup Script is executed when the compute instance boots up. It updates the system, installs Apache, and sets up a static HTML page with images. It ensures the web server starts every time the instance reboots and deploys the website automatically.
Variables
- Let me to parameterize configurations like project IDs, regions, machine types, and image IDs. This makes configurations reusable and adaptable without hardcoding values.
Outputs
- These display information about the resources the deployment is completed, like IP addresses, URLs for applications, or useful metadata.
